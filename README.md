# OMSI-LogHelper

This tool is an attempt to make the OMSI log file more understandable and accessible. 

Often the log file is confusing, and important information is hidden between unimportant information. 

With this tool, the focus should be put on the really critical things. That's why all errors are right at the beginning, so that you can start fixing them immediately.
